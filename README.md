⚙️ How It Works (The Viral Loop)Discovery: User lands on index.html and sees a grid of trending cards.Creation: User selects a card and is sent to create.html. They enter the recipient's name.Monetization: An "Ad-Gate" is triggered. The user waits/watches an ad while the "Magic Link" is prepared.Distribution: User copies the link or clicks "Share on WhatsApp".The Hook: The recipient opens the link (e.g., .../cards/valentine/index.html?n=Yavya). The page uses URL Parameters to inject the name "Yavya" into the experience.Reciprocity: At the end of the experience, a button invites the recipient to "Create your own," restarting the loop.📊 Content Management (The Google Sheet)To add a new card, you never edit index.html. You simply add a row to the linked Google Sheet:TitleCategoryEmojiFileNameImpossible NoValentine🌹valentine/index.htmlBirthday BlastBirthday🎂birthday/blast.html
